# Stack Operations  

## 📌 Introduction  
A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.  
This means the element inserted last will be removed first.  

Common real-life examples:  
- A stack of plates.  
- Undo/Redo operations in text editors.  
- Browser back/forward navigation.

## ⚙️ Basic Operations  
1. **Push** → Insert an element into the stack.  
2. **Pop** → Remove the top element from the stack.  
3. **Peek/Top** → Get the top element without removing it.  
4. **isEmpty** → Check whether the stack is empty.  
5. **isFull** → Check whether the stack is full (only for fixed-size stack).
